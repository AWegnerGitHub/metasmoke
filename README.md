# metasmoke

Metasmoke is a web dashboard for [SmokeDetector](//github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector), a bot that detects spam on the [Stack Exchange network](http://stackexchange.com/sites).

### API
If you're looking to develop using the metasmoke API, there's documentation available [in the wiki](//github.com/Charcoal-SE/metasmoke/wiki/API-Documentation). You'll need an API key to access any of the routes; ping a [metasmoke admin](http://charcoal-se.org/people#admins) in [Charcoal HQ](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq).

### License
Metasmoke is a pretty niche project, and we don't expect many people to make use of the entire thing as a whole. However, if you want to use the code, go right ahead - metasmoke is licensed under CC0. A small attribution is appreciated, but entirely non-compulsory.
